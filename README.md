LaMa is a Thematic Labelling web application that can be used by multiple users to analyse and label artifacts. This tool was developed by a team of 9 students for the Final Bachelor Project at the Eindhoven University of Technology.

The tool was created to facilitate collaboration and peer feedback on labelled artifacts. Additionally, it provides a cheaper option compared to its competitors, such as Atlas.ti [2] and maxQDA [1]. LaMa allows for the user to label text in order to find patterns in qualitative data. Using this tool will allow for an easier, faster, and more structured way for one or more people to label a given text and resolve any conflicts that arise between labels.

This project builds upon the already existing [Labeling Machine tool](https://github.com/muctadir/labeling-machine) by extending it and adding new functionalities, which include but are not limited to a new API and remaking the User Interface (UI).
