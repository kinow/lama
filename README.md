# Software End Project (SEP)

![LaMa logo](/frontend/assets/lama_nobg.png)
===
LaMa is a Thematic Labelling web application that can be used by multiple users to analyse and label artifacts. This tool was developed by a team of 9 students for the Final Bachelor Project at the Eindoven University of Technology. 

This project aims to build upon the already existing [Labeling Machine tool](https://github.com/muctadir/labeling-machine) by extending it and adding new functionalities, which include but are not limited to a new API and remaking the User Interface (UI).

# Deployment Setup
If the application is still deployed on the TU/e server
1. Go to https://lamahost.win.tue.nl/api

# Development Setup

## Part 1: First-time setup
1. If you have don't have a TU/e laptop or you have already done this, skip to Part 2
2. Windows+R and type `powershell` and hit Ctrl+Shift+Enter and click yes
3. Enter `set-executionpolicy remotesigned` in the powershell
4. Choose [Y]es and close powershell

## Part 2: Starting Up
1. Start docker
2. Open powershell from vs code (or powershell in the project directory)
3. Type `start` and press tab once on Linux, or twice on Windows, then hit enter
4. Choose based on operating system (this is a step to make sure you ran the correct script in the last step)
5. Choose the type of deployment (1: production, 2: frontend, 3: backend)
6. See possible errors in Part 4

## Part 2.1: Initializing Database
Only needs to be done the first time
1. In the vs code powershell run `docker exec lama-flask flask db-opt init`

## Part 3: Closing Down
1. Open powershell from vs code (or powershell in the project directory)
2. Type `stop` and press tab once on Linux, or twice on Windows, then hit enter
3. Choose based on operating system (this is a step to make sure you ran the correct script in the last step)

## Part 4: Known Errors
`Error response from daemon: i/o timeout`:<br />
Reason 1: Port 80 is in use already (by another docker container) <br />
Fix: Close the app (Part 3), delete the container and retry Part 2 <br />

Reason 2: Took too long to boot. <br />
Fix: Close the app (Part 3). Starting up is faster the second time so retry. If it's still too slow, see other possible reasons, or give up.

### Notes:
1. The phpMyAdmin will always runs on port 81
2. The app should work with many different kinds of drivers and dialects if you do not want to use MySQL
    (see [here](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/engines.html))
3. Environment variables to customize database URI are in backend\.env
4. Forcibly closing docker will cause the app to boot automatically the next time docker opens (in case of system failure).
5. Make sure that no other SQL instances or databases are running at the same time
