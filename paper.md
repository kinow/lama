# Summary

Qualitative analysis of data is relevant for a variety of domains, among which empirical research studies. When analysing large data sets such as StackOverflow, Apache Mailing Lists, and GitHub issues qualitatively, condensing pieces of data to a set of terms or keywords simplifies analysis, and helps in obtaining useful insight. This condensation of data can be achieved by associating keywords “labels” with text fragments “artifacts”. To achieve greater accuracy, and limit bias, collaboration and consensus building is essential. LaMa (Labelling Machine) is an open-source web application for thematic labelling of qualitative data. The application facilitates cooperation through simultaneous analysis by different researchers, as well as consensus building through conflict resolution techniques. The source code is available at: https://github.com/muctadir/lama

# Statement of need

# Key features
LaMa is in its core functionality similar to comparable labelling tools for qualitative analysis, however a number of key features ensure greater consensus and collaboration between users, as well as provide additional insight. 
- **Conflict resolution**: To ensure consensus during collaboration automatic conflict detection has been implemented. Users can view the disagreement and are provided with a variety of methods to resolve the conflict.
- **Dynamic entities**: Complex input data and user defined constructs can be broken up into parts, or merged to ensure simplicity of analysis as well as coherence.
- **Themes**: Lama allows users to group labels into themes, thereby providing a way of classifying data and the analysis of the data. In additional themes categorized hierarchically further aiding in the analysis and classification process.
- **Visualizing hierarchy**: To obtain insight into how artifacts are mapped to labels, and labels ordered into themes, a visualization of the hierarchy can be constructed on demand.
